 'given away to his friends. A third of the remaining slices are given away to '
 'his family. Alex eats 3 slices. How many slices of the cake are left?'] * 4
================================================================================
contents = ['According to the text, Alex starts with 2 cakes of 8 slices each and cuts '
 'them into 4 equal pieces.\n'

 'After cutting, he gives away one-fourth of this amount: 2*8/4 = 4 pieces\n'
 'This must have been 8 pieces. Now, there are 2*',

 'After dividing the 2 cakes into 8 pieces, Alex would have 8/2 = 4 slices '
 'left.\n'
 'Then, 1/4 of the slices are eaten by his friends, leaving him with 4 - 3 = 1 '
 'slice left.\n'
 'A third of the slices are eaten by his family,',

 'Based on the given information, The solution would be 51 total same slices '
 "given away. First, let's determine the total slices of the cakes Alex gives "
 'away to his family:\n'

 'A fourth of the slices are given away to his friends:\n'
 ' split the first cake into 8 slices\n'
 ' The second cake is 8',

 'Based on the information in the problem, we can deduce that Alex initially '
 'has 16 slices of cake. He gave 3 slices to friends, leading to 13 slices '
 'left. #7 is based on the information between the blue cells.  If 4 of them '
 'are given away to his friends,']
